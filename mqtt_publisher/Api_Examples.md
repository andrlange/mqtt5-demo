```

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Start Services
```bash
# Start Mosquitto broker
cd mqtt-demo
docker-compose up -d

# Start Spring Boot application
cd spring-boot-mqtt-publisher
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Subscribe to Test Messages (using mosquitto_sub)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Subscribe to all clients
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -V 5 -u subscriber1 -P sub123 -t clients/all

# Terminal 2: Subscribe to specific client
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -V 5 -u subscriber2 -P sub456 -t client/subscriber2

# Terminal 3: Subscribe to system topics (as publisher to see all)
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -V 5 -u publisher -P publisher123 -t '$SYS/#'
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test 1: Publish to all
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/mqtt/publish/all \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Broadcast message"}'

# Test 2: Publish to specific client
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/mqtt/publish/client/subscriber1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Private message"}'

# Test 3: Subscribe to system topics
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/mqtt/subscribe/sys

# Test 4: Try unknown client (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/mqtt/publish/client/nonexistent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "This should fail"}'
```

### 4. Monitor Logs
Check Spring Boot application logs to see:
- MQTT connection status
- Published messages
- System topic information
- Error messages for unknown clients

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
```bash
# Empty message (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/mqtt/publish/all \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": ""}'
```

### MQTT Connection Issues
- Check if Mosquitto broker is running
- Verify credentials in `application.yml`
- Check network connectivity

### Known Client Management
- Use `/api/mqtt/clients/{client}` to add new clients
- Check `/api/mqtt/clients` to see current list
- Real implementation should use database for client management
